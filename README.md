# Download / Installation

All addons should be installed via the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Addon-Manager). No more loaders needed. This addon manager should handle everything real easily.

If you have previous addons installed, it's best to delete them all and start from scratch using this app. This includes the `addons` folder and all of the previous ipfs (including SumAni.ipf!). No more loaders needed.
